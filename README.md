# JETS PROJECT

## Description
Jets Project is an interactive program that uses file IO to retrieve a list of aircraft.
Those aircraft are stored into a list that can be manipulated by the user while running the program. Users can view the list, add or remove from the list, and choose to "use" the aircraft in different ways.

### Lessons Learned
While coding this program, I would say the biggest challenge was using inheritance and understanding how encapsulation works for you (or against you), and how to ensure a safe and secure program while still checking all of the boxes off for user requirements.

### Favorite Part

My favorite part with this project was manipulating the code. I ended up spending a lot of time moving things around to ensure proper encapsulation and make sure the program was as efficient as it could be.

### Least Favorite Part 
My least favorite part of this project was figuring out how to check if a class implemented an interface. I will say, that despite it being my least favorite, the frustration it caused will hopefully solidify my understanding of the mechanisms.
